My Reading List is a small application developed for learning purposes as well as to be included in my portfolio of projects! Thank you! 

This application has a separate back-end and front-end. This repo includes the code for the back-end of the application, while the front-end can be found and accessed here: https://github.com/mirlindm/my-reading-list-frontend.

The back-end of the application is developed using Node.js and Express, and it is the first time that I am learning and using GraphQL on the back-end as opposed to the REST API architecture.

I am amazed by GraphQL, its power and robustness! It will definitely be included in my next projets! 

Instructions on running this application:

After cloning or downloading the repository, open the project in your favorite Code Editor.
Using a terminal of your choice, run the following commands:
1) npm install
2) npm run dev or npm run start

Navigate to the browser: http://localhost:4000/graphql

Note: Make sure to also run the front-end application: https://github.com/mirlindm/my-reading-list-frontend

After having both applications up and running on the different ports, navigate to the front-end React app: http://localhost:3000/ and play around with the app.
Example: Add a new book you like, fetch the information of any of the books from the list, etc. 

Enjoy!
